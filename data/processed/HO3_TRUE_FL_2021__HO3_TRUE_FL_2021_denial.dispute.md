## A. Plain-English overview of the dispute

The insureds reported water damage to their kitchen and living room, but the insurer denied the claim primarily due to late notice, damage caused by long-term leakage and wear and tear, pre-existing damage, failure to protect the property from further damage, and the loss amount being below the deductible. The insurer relies on policy conditions requiring prompt notice and duties after loss, as well as exclusions for gradual damage and deterioration.

## B. Coverage highlights that may support the insured

- Coverage for sudden and accidental direct physical loss to the dwelling and attached structures. (SECTION: SECTION I - PERILS INSURED AGAINST; SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES)
- Limited additional coverage for damage related to fungi, wet or dry rot, or bacteria, subject to specific conditions and limits. (SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES)

## C. Key exclusions / limitations that may hurt the insured

- Exclusion of loss caused by wear and tear, deterioration, and continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water over time. (SECTION: EXCLUSIONS; SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES)
- Requirement for prompt notice of loss and cooperation; late notice that prejudices the insurer can lead to denial. (SECTION: CONDITIONS; SECTION: COVERAGE U - NDER THIS POLICY TO AN “ASSIGNEE” IF THE)
- Deductible applies to covered losses; losses below deductible amount are not payable. (SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES; SECTION: CONDITIONS)
- Obligation to protect property from further damage after loss; failure to do so can limit or void coverage for additional damage. (SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES; SECTION: CONDITIONS)

## D. Denial reasons (as stated or implied by the insurer)

- Late notice of the loss prevented timely inspection and investigation, prejudicing the insurer. (SECTION: CONDITIONS; SECTION: DUTIES AFTER LOSS)
- Damage resulted from long-term leakage and wear and tear, which are excluded per policy terms. (SECTION: EXCLUSIONS; SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES)
- Some damage pre-existed the reported loss date, and the insured failed to take reasonable steps to protect the property from further damage. (SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES; SECTION: CONDITIONS)
- The amount of covered damage after depreciation and exclusions is below the applicable deductible, so no payment is owed. (SECTION I - PROPERTY COVERAGES; SECTION: CONDITIONS)

## E. Possible dispute angles to explore (not legal advice)

- Whether the insured’s notice delay was unreasonable and whether the insurer was truly prejudiced by the late notice.

- Photos or reports documenting the condition of the property immediately before and after the loss date.

## G. Confidence and clauses to verify

- **Confidence score (0–1):** 0.90
- **Notes:** The denial letter clearly cites policy conditions and exclusions that align with the policy summaries provided. The main issues of late notice, wear and tear exclusion, pre-existing damage, and deductible application are well supported. However, some ambiguity remains around the exact timing and nature of damage and mitigation efforts, which could affect coverage analysis.
